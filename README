Net-SMS-TMobile-UK

T-Mobile is a major mobile network. Their UK Website allows the sending of 
'webtext' messages which are an SMS sent from the users mobile number and 
charged against their mobile phone account. This module allows the sending
of these messages - ideal if you pay for a bundle of SMS messages in advance.

Please note that this module is nothing to do with T-Mobile, and will probably
stop working should T-Mobile ever change the method for sms submission.
